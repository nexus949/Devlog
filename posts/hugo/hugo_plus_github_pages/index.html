<p>Using HUGO to generate a static site and host it on Github Pages was pretty annoying.</p>
<p>It was very easy on the development side of things, deployment was the opposite but got it sorted it.

It was <strong>HTML ONLY !</strong></p>
<p>Checked the <code>baseURL</code> in the <code>hugo.toml</code> file and everything was correct, rebuilt it multiple times with different settings like from scratch, not using build cache and other stuff none worked. Thanks to Copilot which suggested me to see networks tab in the dev tools and there I found that due an <em><strong>integrity mismatch</strong></em> the files were blocked !</p>
